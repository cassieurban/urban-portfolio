          <h3>NASA wants ME!!</h3>
          <p> So I've been struggling pretty hard to get an internship for this summer. I've applied everywhere
            you could think of. I truly don't know what I want to do once I graduate, but something in either production,
            web design or social media would be awesome.</p>

            <p>I've been really into space the past year. I've followed along with Scott Kelly, an astronaut who spent a full
              year in space on the ISS (International Space Station). I've been stalking him on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
              and keeping up with his journey. It blows my mind that he was out changing the world, collecting data for future
              space travels to Mars/ space, spent a full year away from his family, and survived living in space. He's truly incredible.</p>

              <p> Since I've been following up with him, I thought I should start looking into jobs/ internships at NASA. After
                searching, I found out they have a social media team called 'NASASocial.' They post about events social media enthusiasts
                can apply to, and will be accepted only if wanted. It's not a random selection. NASA thoroughly goes through each and every
                application to see if that person will be the right fit for them. I decided to apply to a few events, not expecting to even
                get looked at. 9 days later, I receive an email saying I'VE BEEN ACCEPTED!!!</p>

              <h4> NASA wanted ME. They chose ME to be among 50 other people out of nearly 400 applications.</h4>

                <p>Man oh man did I think this was a joke.</p>

                <p>I read the email about 500 times and made sure it was sent to the right person. I have the worst luck in America. Something
                  this AMAZING has never happened to me before. I started shaking and getting butterflies in my stomach. After all these
                  years of struggling through school, dealing with so many awful life experiences and
                  never finding that one person to give me a chance; NASA decided to choose me.</p>

                <p> SO. At the end of May, I will be traveling to CALIFORNIA and embarking on a journey I've always dreamed of.
                  I will be touring NASA's facilities, experiencing live sonic booms, and getting the opportunity to talk with the team
                  of NASASocial. Did I mention I'll be in CALIFORNIA????</p>

                  <p>I'm also going to throw it out there that the Kardashians live in California, and if you think I won't be spending
                    a few extra days to explore Los Angeles and Hollywood in hopes of seeing Kylie Jenner taking selfies or Kim Kardashian
                    West on a stroll with North and Saint West, you're crazy.</p>

                  <p>I'm so incredibly #blessed to have a company like NASA give me the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>

                  <p> Thank you NASA for making my dreams come true. Also, thank you for letting me travel to California in hopes of
                    meeting the Kardashians. I will forever be grateful.</p>

                  <h4> See ya on the West Coast on May 30th!</h4>

          <h3>Life as a no-longer-undergrad</h3>
          <p> Almost 4 years ago, I was deciding where I wanted to go to college. I wanted to get far away from home and live my life
            to the fullest. I wanted to be somewhere where I could escape to and be on my own; so that's exactly what I did. I was very
            strong willed that time in my life if you couldn't tell.</p>

          <p>Now it's 2016, I've been a student at 3 colleges and I'm graduating in a year. I attended Keene State in New Hampshire my
            freshman year, Eastern CT my sophomore year, and UConn-Stamford as a junior and senior. I've lived at school for 2 years, so transferring
            to a college where I have to live at home and commute was a pretty hard decision to make. But I've dreamed of going to UConn
            my entire life. I've applied here 3 times and finally got accepted and decided to suck it up so I can have a degree from UConn
            in Digital Media and Design.</p>

          <p> I go through quarter life crisis' at least once a week about getting older. How am I already almost 22 years old and a senior
            in college...? How am I supposed to learn how to live in real-life without my mom...? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW THAT I CAN'T
            EAT CHICKEN NUGGETS FOR DINNER EVERY NIGHT? My life is falling apart. Now that I'm old, I can't have dino chicken nuggets every
            night, I need to learn to not call my mom every time I don't know how to do something, and I need to learn how to "adult." Um, what?</p>

          <p> Anyway, long story short - I've come a long way since senior year of high school. I'm at a good place in my life right now.
            I've got a family who believes in me and a boyfriend who is very supportive of anything I do. I have a lot of big dreams that I
            hope come true within the next few years (and I refuse to mention what those big dreams are so I don't jinx it).</p>

          <p> Hopefully I'll learn how to do this adult thing soon. Being a no-longer-undergrad is weird, stressful but amazing. On the bright
            side of this, I'll be done with school forever next May. The countdown begins and my days of eating chicken nuggets for dinner
            will slowly come to an end. Ugh. </p>
